Comment(s): The Gleason grade reported in
this synoptic report is a
summative score across all sites
containing adenocarcinoma and is
not necessarily the highest
Gleason grade assigned to a
specific site. In this case, the
highest Gleason grade assigned to
a specific site is 4+4=8/10.

Comment(s): The Gleason grade reported in
this synoptic report is a
summative score across all sites
containing adenocarcinoma and not
necessarily the highest Gleason
grade assigned. The highest
Gleason grade assigned in this
case was 4+4=8/10 (Part A. Right
base lateral).

Comment(s): The Gleason score reported in
this synoptic report is a
summative score across all sites
containing adenocarcinoma and is
not necessarily the highest
Gleason score assigned. In these
biopsies, the highest Gleason
score at a particular site is 4 +
3 = 7/10.
There is a focus that is
suspicious, but not diagnostic,
for perineural invasion in the
biopsy material from the right
base lateral (Part A).

containing adenocarcinoma and is
not the highest Gleason Score
assigned to a specific site. The
highest Gleason Score assigned to
a specific site is 4+4=8/10.

Comment(s): Please note: The quantitation of
carcinoma in this case involves
less than 25% of the surface area
of the core in part E, but
discontinuously spans 80% of the
core. There is little agreement
among pathologists as to whether
to quantify this involvement as
25% or 80%. Please see Karram S,
et al., Am. J. Surg. Path. (2011)
